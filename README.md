# SLIP8266
  
VERY WIP SLIP to WiFi bridge for the ESP8266.
  
  
## What works  
IRC And possibly other low bandwidth applications.  
ICMP Requests.  
  
## What doesn't  
Almost everything lol.  
Large amounts of data will render it in an unusable state.  
  
  
## Notes  
This is really my first entry into low level networking and serial port programming.  
Lots of things are, and will be broken.  
If you see anything dumb let me know so I can learn for the future.
